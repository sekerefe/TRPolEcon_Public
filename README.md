## Abstract

_The Turkish Political Economy Database_ is a digital humanities project that documents over 700 economists, translators, and thinkers who have contributed to the development of economic thought in the Republic of Türkiye and the Ottoman Empire from the 1800s to the present. This project integrates human and AI-assisted methodologies to curate, analyse, and narrate rich biographical and bibliographical data.

Our approach combines traditional archival research with cutting-edge tools, including large language models (LLMs), to generate AI-supported essays that undergo rigorous human review. The project aims to create an openly accessible, searchable platform for researchers interested in Turkish economic history, political economy, and digital historiography.

## Project Objectives

- Create biographical entries for ~700 economists, scholars, translators, and policymakers.
- Build and maintain a structured dataset of biographical and bibliographical metadata.
- Use AI-assisted tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM) to generate summaries and essays.
- Publish interactive visualisations and searchable entries.
- Provide open access to data, code, and documentation for scholarly reuse.

---

## Selection Criteria

Entries in the database include:

- **Turkish-speaking scholars** active from the 1800s onward (e.g., Mehmet Şerif, Sencer Divitçioğlu),
- **Non-Turkish authors** with published research on the Ottoman/Turkish economy (e.g., Charles Issawi),
- **Orientalists, travellers, diplomats** contributing economic accounts (e.g., Nassau Senior),
- **Immigrant and visiting economists** who taught in Türkiye (e.g., Alexander Rüstow),
- **Practitioners and officials** involved in institutionalising economic policy (e.g., Celal Bayar).

---

## Methodology

This project employs digital humanities techniques including:

- **Data curation:** over 80 metadata fields per author (e.g., education, publications, nationality),
- **AI-assisted summarisation and essay writing,** using LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude,
- **Document digitisation and archival work** (scanning and transcribing sources),
- **Data visualisation and mapping,** available interactively on Github and Tableau,
- **Human-in-the-loop editorial process** to verify all AI-generated content for scholarly rigour.

Each entry is derived from structured data and enriched with narrative elements, references, and visual data. Biographical essays are supported by textual sources, citations, and metadata exports.

---

## AI Applications

The project leverages large language models for:

- **Optical character recognition (OCR)** and Ottoman script transliteration,
- **Text summarisation** from historical PDFs, JPEGs, and scanned archives,
- **AI dialogues** that simulate expert historical analysis (e.g., via the "AI Historian" model),
- **Automatic bibliography generation** and citation mapping.

These tools augment traditional historiographic methods and enable novel forms of research, such as thematic or regional citation networks.

---

## Significance

This project contributes to:

- Documenting Türkiye’s intellectual history of economic thought,
- Demonstrating responsible and innovative use of AI in academic research,
- Establishing an openly accessible scholarly database of Turkish economic literature,
- Offering a replicable model for AI-assisted historical scholarship in non-Western contexts.

Upon project completion, the data, essays, tools, and visualisations will be made fully open-access to support research, teaching, and reuse.
